<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged MIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new MIPs. Note that an MIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your MIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `mip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed change intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the MIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the MIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what _will_ be done if the MIP is implemented, not _why_ it should be done or _how_ it will be done. If the MIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the MIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the MIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the MIP will address the issue!-->

This is the problem statement. This is the _why_ of the TDP. It should clearly explain _why_ the current state of the protocol is inadequate. It is critical that you explain _why_ the change is needed, if the TDP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address _why_ the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the TDP will address the issue!

## Specification

The specification should include how and what will change with this proposal.
