  <li>
    Review <a href="MIPS/mip-1.html">MIP-1</a>,
    <a href="MCCP/mccp-1.html">MCCP-1 or TDP-XX.</a> .
  </li>
  <li>
    Fork the <a href="https://github.com/mstable/MIPs">repository</a> by
    clicking "Fork" in the top right.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add your Proposal to your fork of the repository. There is a
    <a href="https://github.com/mstable/MIPs/blob/master/mip-X.md"
      >template MIP here</a
    >,
    <a href="https://github.com/mstable/MIPs/blob/master/mccp-X.md"
      >a template MCCP here</a
    >, and a template TDP here.
  </li>
  <li>
    Submit a Pull Request to mStable's
    <a href="https://github.com/mstable/MIPs">MIPs repository</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Your first PR should be a first draft of the final Proposal. It must meet the
  formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the
  header). An editor will manually review the first PR for a new Proposal and
  assign a number before merging it. Make sure you include a
  <code>discussions-to</code> header with the URL to a discussion forum or open
  GitHub issue where people can discuss the Proposal as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  If your Proposal requires images, the image files should be included in a
  subdirectory of the `assets` folder. E.g. for an MIP:
  <code>assets/mip-X</code> (for mip <b>X</b>). When linking to an image in the
  Proposal, use relative links such as <code>../assets/mip-X/image.png</code>.
</p>
<p>
  When you believe your Proposal is mature and ready to progress past the WIP
  phase, you should post the proposal in the
  <a href="https://forum.mstable.org/">mStable's forum</a>. If the community
  agrees to include it, the editors will update the state of your Proposal to
  <code>Approved</code>.
</p>
